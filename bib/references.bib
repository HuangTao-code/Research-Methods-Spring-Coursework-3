  abstract = {Numerous studies have shown that feedback on energy consumption can work to effectively reduce household energy consumption. However, relatively little work has been done on the best ways to present information in order to maximise energy savings. In this work, different ways of presenting feedback on electricity consumption were systematically analysed and user interface prototypes were developed based on the analysis. The prototypes were shown to consumers in qualitative interviews to gain information on how well they understood them and what kind of feedback they prefer to receive on their electricity consumption. The results show that the following features of feedback on electricity consumption are most valued by consumers: presentations of costs (over a period of time), appliance-specific breakdown, i.e. information on what proportion is consumed by each appliance, and historical comparison, i.e. comparison with their own prior consumption.},

  abstract = {Energy is the lifeblood of modern societies. In the past decades, the world's energy consumption and associated CO2 emissions increased rapidly due to the increases in population and comfort demands of people. Building energy consumption prediction is essential for energy planning, management, and conservation. Data-driven models provide a practical approach to energy consumption prediction. This paper offers a review of the studies that developed data-driven building energy consumption prediction models, with a particular focus on reviewing the scopes of prediction, the data properties and the data preprocessing methods used, the machine learning algorithms utilized for prediction, and the performance measures used for evaluation. Based on this review, existing research gaps are identified and future research directions in the area of data-driven building energy consumption prediction are highlighted.},

After examining relevant bodies of literature on the effects of energy feedback on consumption behaviour, and on the complex role of energy and appliances within household moral economies, the paper draws on qualitative evidence from interviews with 15 UK householders trialling smart energy monitors of differing levels of sophistication. It focuses specifically on householder motivations for acquiring the monitors, how the monitors have been used, how feedback has changed consumption behaviour, and the limitations to further behavioural change the householders experienced. The paper concludes by identifying significant implications for future research and policy in this area.},

  abstract = {Eco-feedback technology provides feedback on individual or group behaviors with a goal of reducing environmental impact. The history of eco-feedback extends back more than 40 years to the origins of environmental psychology. Despite its stated purpose, few HCI eco-feedback studies have attempted to measure behavior change. This leads to two overarching questions: (1) what can HCI learn from environmental psychology and (2) what role should HCI have in designing and evaluating eco-feedback technology? To help answer these questions, this paper conducts a comparative survey of eco-feedback technology, including 89 papers from environmental psychology and 44 papers from the HCI and UbiComp literature. We also provide an overview of predominant models of proenvironmental behaviors and a summary of key motivation techniques to promote this behavior.},

Being able to understand data collected in a dynamic, interactive, and personalized way allows for better decisions to be made when optimizing and improving performance. Although its importance is known, there is a gap in the research regarding its design, choice criteria, and uses in the field of building energy consumption. Therefore, this review discusses the state-of-the-art of visualization techniques used in the field of energy performance, in particular by considering two types of building analysis: simulation and monitoring. Likewise, data visualizations are categorized according to goals, level of detail and target users. Visualization tools published in the scientific literature, as well as those currently used in the IoT platforms and visualization software, were analyzed. This overview can be used as a starting point when choosing the most efficient data visualization for a specific type of building energy analysis.},

  abstract = {The building sector, and especially residential households and office buildings, account for a large share of global emissions. Meanwhile, energy literacy is extremely low amongst residents and citizens in general, leading to insufficient evaluations of energy efficiency measures and technology equipment for buildings. To address this issue, we develop a research model and design an experiment to evaluate the ability of a website with interactive and vivid features to convey information in an engaging way, thus increasing the users’ enjoyment and their intention to (re)-use and recommend the website as well as the usefulness for information retrieval and technology evaluation. We conduct an experiment with two treatments in which the participants interact with an animated and a static website, respectively. While participants’ self-assessed knowledge improvement is statistically higher in the animated treatment, no difference was found in tested knowledge assessment or technology-specific knowledge. We find that the vividness of the website plays an important role for both the utilitarian and hedonic purpose of the website. However, somewhat contrasting to existing theories, interactivity did not increase enjoyment or diagnosticity.},

Information about residential houses is useful for promoting community well-being, protecting the environment, and fostering economic growth. By digging into the residential houses, we can accurately identify sudden spikes in energy consumption. Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) play a critical role in reducing wasteful energy consumption by providing precise information about a home's energy efficiency. Unfortunately, inadequate EPC evaluations and suggestions contribute to the growing demand for energy. This research presents the creation of a smart web-based visual analytics platform that utilises data from cross-sectoral data to examine the effect of various variables on current house energy performance certificates (EPCs). In addition, our study illustrates a technique for mapping stakeholder assessments before offering substantial recommendations for refurbishments. To determine which smart home criteria are most important, we apply the Criterion Importance Through Intercriterion Correlation (CRITIC) method and weight the criteria based on their correlations. Finally, we sort smart house by their Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) ratings using the COmplex PRoportional ASsessment (COPRAS) technique.},

  abstract = {In response to growing concerns over climate change and rising energy costs, a number of eco-feedback systems are being tested by researchers. Yet, the interface design aspect of these systems has largely been ignored. Therefore, the role that interface design plays at the component level in driving actual energy savings from users is unclear. In this paper, we evaluate the impact interface design has on eco-feedback performance by investigating five established design components. We conducted a six week empirical study with 43 participants using a prototype eco-feedback interface. Analysis of usage data affirmed a statistically significant inverse correlation between user engagement (measured as logins) and energy consumption. Utilizing this relationship as a basis for performance, we expanded our analysis to evaluate the five design components. The study revealed statistically significant evidence corroborating that historical comparison and incentives are design components that drive higher engagement and thus reductions in energy consumption. Results for the normative comparison and disaggregation components were inconclusive, while results for the rewards and penalization component suggest that a revision to the penalization aspect of the component may be necessary. This study raises pertinent questions regarding the efficacy of various eco-feedback components in eliciting energy savings.},

For these visualizations to achieve their aim, they must not only target people’s energy saving objectives but also support the necessary factors that help people to change their underlying energy consumption behavior. In this paper, we survey several categories of existing interactive energy visualizations and through a number of selected examples in each case, identify possible potentials for supporting any user behavior changes. For this survey, we have used the behavior change model originally proposed by B. J. Fogg, which defines three factors of motivation, trigger and ability. Our survey has shown that most existing interactive visualizations target the motivation factor, with some supporting trigger or ability and only a few dealing with all the three factors of the behavior change model.},
